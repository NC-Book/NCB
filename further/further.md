# Further reading
The format of a textbook only allows for very limited references to allow for a smooth read and reduce the number of printed pages and hence the price of the product. For this reason only absolutely essential references were cited in "Networks and Complexity". There are however many other valuable and relevant sources that I would like to point out to the reader. Also the book casts a very wide net, spanning several disciplines, and thus there may be many several very useful papers out there that the author is not aware of. Therefore we have decided to include this guide to additional material as online appendices. These files are intended as living documents. So contributions, including reasonable self-promotion, are explicitly invited and can be submitted as pull requests.
