# Research Project Ideas

Here is a list of some interesting projects that can be worked on using the methods from the book. 
These would make nice group projects for groups of interested students or perhaps for a single student in a bachelor thesis. 
Some might be expandable into Master's thesis or research papers.

If you successfully complete one of the projects and publish your results somewhere (possibly in a journal, possibly just on a repository 
or your homepage) then let me know so I can link your report from the question. Alternatively add a link to your solution via a pull request.
