\exercise{Averages revision \label{exSWaverage}}{1}
Compute the averages of the following sequences of numbers: a) $3,7,5$;  b) $1,3,6,1,2,5$;  c) a sequence consisting of 13 times the number 3 and 7 times the number 17. 

\solution
We find the solution by adding up all the numbers and dividing by the number of numbers that we added up. This means for part (a)
\eq{
\frac{3+7+5}{3} = \frac{15}{3}=5
}
For part (b)
\eq{
\frac{1+3+6+1+2+5}{6}= \frac{18}{6}=3
}
For part (c) we can save us some work by using multiplication to add up the numbers rather than adding them up term by term 
\eq{
\frac{13\cdot 3 + 7 \cdot 17}{13+7}= \frac{39+119}{20} = \frac{158}{20}=7+\frac{18}{20}=7.9
}
