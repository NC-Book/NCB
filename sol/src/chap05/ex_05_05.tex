\exercise{Social diameter of Iceland\label{exSWiceland}}{2}
Iceland has a population of 340,000. Let's assume that the mean degree of the acquaintance network in Iceland is $z=120$ and the clustering coefficient is $c=0.2$. Estimate the social diameter of Iceland. 

\solution
We can use our formula for diameter with clustering
\eqa{
D&=&\log_{(1-c)z}((1-c)N) \\
 &=& \log_{96}(272,000) \\ 
 &\approx& 2.74
}
