\exercise{Product Formula}{3}
Consider the Kronecker product
\eq{
{\bf J}={\bf A}\otimes {\bf B}
}
where $\bf A$ and $\bf B$ are matrices. Find a formula that relates the eigenvalues of $\bf J$ to the eigenvalues of $\bf A$ and $\bf B$. (This is very similar, but simpler than the derivation in the lecture. Formulate an Ansatz for the eigenvector $\vec{v}$, then show that it works and find the eigenvalue on the way).

\solution
We use the Ansatz 
\eq{
\vec{v} = \vec{a} \otimes \vec{b}  
}
We now show that (under suitable assumptions) this is an eigenvector of $\bf J$. We write
\eqa{
{\bf J}\vec{v} &=& ({\bf A}\otimes {\bf B}) (\vec{a} \otimes \vec{b}) \\
 &=& {\bf A}\vec{a}\otimes {\bf B}\vec{b} \\
 &=& \alpha\vec{a}\otimes \beta \vec{b} \\
 &=& \alpha\beta (\vec{a}\otimes \vec{b}) \\
 &=& \alpha\beta \vec{v} 
}
Where we had to assume that $\vec{a}$ is an eigenvector of $\bf A$ with eigenvalue $\alpha$ (i.e.~$\vec{a}{\bf A}=\alpha \vec{a}$) and similarly $\vec{b}{\bf B}=\beta \vec{b}$.

The calculation above shows that if $\bf J$ is a Kronecker product of 2 matrices and we know the eigenvectors of these matrices, then the Kronecker product of two a pair of eigenvectors is an eigenvector of $\bf J$ and the corresponding eigenvalue is the product of the two eigenvalues. 

We can see that the number of eigenvalues we can construct in this way is 
\eq{{\rm dim }({\bf A})\cdot {\rm dim }({\bf B}) = {\rm dim }({\bf J})}
hence we can find all eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $\bf J$ in this way.
