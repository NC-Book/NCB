\exercise{Simple  timescale renormalization}{1}
In the system
\eqn{\dot{x}=k(x-x^2)}
renormalize the timescale to make the parameter $k$ disappear.
(Hint: If you are not sure how to do it, renomalise time by a factor $a$ and then decide how you need to chose this factor.)

\solution 
We define 
\eq{
\tau = a t
}
Hence
\eq{
\frac{\partial t}{\partial \tau} = \frac{1}{a}.
}
Therefore
\eq{
\frac{{\rm d}x}{{\rm d}\tau} = \frac{\partial t}{\partial \tau} \frac{{\rm d}x}{{\rm d}t} =\frac{1}{a} k(x-x^2)
}
This in the new units of time we can write 
\eq{
\dot{x}=\frac{k}{a} (x-x^2)
}
Chosing $a=k$, yields the desired equation
\eq{
\dot{x}= (x-x^2)
}
Note we can always set one of the rates in the system to one by means of a timescale renormalization.
