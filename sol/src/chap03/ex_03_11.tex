\exercise{The best bridgewalk}{5}
Formulate an efficient algorithm that finds the shortest eulerian circuit in a given network. (Of course every eulerian circuit will involve all bridges, but in a real city different eulerian circuits may cover very different distances while walking from one bridge to the next.)

\solution{
In contrast to most unsolved problems, this one is not very famous. This means the chances are higher that there is an elegant solution. A good way to start is probably to define a distance matrix for the each node that describes the distances between bridges in the respective node.
