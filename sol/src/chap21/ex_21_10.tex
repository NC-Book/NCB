\exercise{P or NP}
Find a polynomial time algorithm that can determine if a given network contains a symmetry.

\solution 
I have none. This is a famous unsolved problem. It is actually easy to find polynomial algorithms that fail only in very few cases such as the Frucht graph (google it!), also there are some algorithms that are very fast even for very large networks but actually do not scale polynomially. 

\exercise{General cycle invasibility}
Find the general invasibility condition for a network containing a cycle of length $n$. 

\solution
This one may actually have a simple solution, but I haven't seen one yet.
