\exercise{Norm \label{exFriendsNorm}}{2}
We now consider the two distributions from Ex.~6.1 (a) and (b) as degree distributions of networks. Show that these distributions are correctly normalized, i.e.~$\sum p_k =1$.

\solution
From Ex.~6.1 we already know that the distribution for (a) can be written as 
\eq{
p_k=\frac34 \delta_{k,4} + \frac14 \delta_{k,8}.
}
We now compute 
\eq{
\sum p_k = \sum \left(\frac34 \delta_{k,4} + \frac14 \delta_{k,8}\right) = \frac{3}{4}+\frac14 = 1,
}
which shows that the distribution is correctly normalized. 

Similarly for case (b) we compute 
\eq{
\sum p_k = \sum \left(\frac13 \delta_{k,3} + \frac13 \delta_{k,4} + \frac13 \delta_{k,14}\right) = \frac13+\frac13+\frac13 = 1.
}
