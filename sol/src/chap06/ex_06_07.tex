\exercise{Manhattan \label{exFriendsManhattan}}{3}
In a city every road junction is a 4-way intersection. Write the degree distribution $p_k$ for the network where intersections are represented by nodes and the road segments connecting them are links. Then show mathematically that $z=4$ and $q=3$. 

\solution
Since every intersection connects to 4 roads, every node has degree 4, and hence 
\eq{
p_k = \delta_{4,k}.
}
To compute the mean degree mathematically we use 
\eqa{
z&=&\sum k p_k \\ 
 &=&\sum k \delta_{4,k} \\
 &=&\sum 4 \delta_{4,k} \\
 &=& 4.
}
This shows that we should expect that a randomly chosen intersection connects to 4 roads. No big surprise, since this is true for every intersection individually.

To find the mean excess degree $q$ we first find the excess degree distribution
\eqa{
q_k&=&(k+1)p_{k+1}/z \\
 &=&(k+1)\delta_{4,k+1}/4 \\
 &=& \delta_{4,k+1} \\
 &=& \delta_{3,k}.
}
We can now compute the mean excess degree 
\eqa{
q&=& \sum k q_k \\
 &=& \sum k \delta_{3,k} \\
 &=& 3.
}
So our expectation is that if we follow a random link then we will find three further links at the next intersection (i.e.~go straight, turn right, turn left). Again this isn't a big surprise, but it is good to see that the maths works out correctly.
