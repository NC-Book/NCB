\exercise{Flashback to six degrees}{2}
The mean degree of the human contact network is about $z=150$. Estimate the proportion of people that are in the giant component.
(Assume that the contact network is an ER random graph.)

\solution
We start with an initial guess $s_0=0.5$ and iterate 
\eq{
s = 1-\exp{-sz}.
}
In this case already the first iteration step yields
\eq{
s= 1-\exp{-75}\approx 1 
}
At such a high mean degree we can expect everybody to be in the giant component.
