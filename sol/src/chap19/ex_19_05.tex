\exercise{Traffic: Degree centrality}{3}
Consider the network from the previous exercise again, but this time determine the degree centrality. Is the result reasonable?

\solution
This one is straight forward. 
\begin{center}
A: 3, B: 4, C: 4, D: 3, E: 4, F: 4, G: 4, H: 3, X: 1
\end{center}
The result is reasonable but not very useful. It tells us that crossroads are more important than dead ends, but does not help us distinguish the relative importance of the degree 4 nodes.
