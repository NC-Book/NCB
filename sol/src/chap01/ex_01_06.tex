\exercise{Larger abstract example}{2}
Construct the minimal spanning tree in a network where the weight of links is given by
\eqn{
{\bf D}=\left(\begin{array}{c c c c c c} 
0  & 8  & 1  & 14 & 4  & 5  \\
8  & 0  & 7  & 12 & 9  & 10  \\
1  & 7  & 0  & 11 & 3  & 2  \\
14 & 12 & 11 & 0  & 15 & 13  \\
4  & 9  & 3  & 15 & 0  & 6  \\
5  & 10 & 2  & 13 & 6  & 0  \\   
\end{array} \right).
}
To reduce the tediousness, the distances in this exercise have been chosen as 1,2,3, and so on. (Hint: If you draw unknown networks like this one it is best to arrange nodes in a circle.)

\solution
Using Kruskal's algorithm we do the following:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
\item Try (1,3) [1] -- accept 
\item Try (3,6) [2] -- accept
\item Try (3,5) [3] -- accept
\item Try (1,5) [4] -- reject
\item Try (1,6) [5] -- reject
\item Try (5,6) [6] -- reject
\item Try (2,3) [7] -- accept
\item Try (1,2) [8] -- reject
\item Try (2,5) [9] -- reject
\item Try (2,6) [10] -- reject
\item Try (3,4) [11] -- accept
\end{enumerate}
Hence, the edge set of the solution is 
\eq{
E=\{(1,3),(3,6),(3,5),(2,3),(3,4) \}.
}
