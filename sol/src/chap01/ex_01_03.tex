\exercise{Number of networks}{1}
Compute the number of different networks that can be constructed between 7 labeled nodes.

% solution %

\solution
First we compute the number of links. Using the trick from the previous question we find $K_{\rm max}=7 \cdot 3=21$. Every link can be there or not, so two possible options per link. Therefore the number of networks is
\eq{
M=2^{21} = 2097152.
