A population of bacteria X grows by cell division at rate $g$
\eqn{
\mbox{X} \xrightarrow{g} 2 \mbox{ X} 
}
In addition the bacteria die spontaneously at rate $l$
\eqn{
\mbox{X} \xrightarrow{l} \oslash 
}
Derive an ODE for the population size $x$ and solve it. 

\solution
Both processes are proportional to $X$ and increase / reduce the number of bacteria by 1 respectively, hence
\eq{
\dot{x} = gx-lx = (g-l)x
}
We already solved such a linear equation in the chapter. The solution is 
\eq{
x(t)=x_0 \exp{(g-l)t}
}
