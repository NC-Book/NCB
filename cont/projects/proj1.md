# Make a bridgewalk

People love bridgewalks. The walk that I designed for the city of Bristol was quite successful (it has received extensive news coverage, 
has a [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Bridges_Walk), and an active [facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/430454211044717)).

You can do the same for your city if your city is suitable, obviously you need bridges and they need to be in a configuration that permits an eulerian walk, 
but more about this below. 

## How to do it
You can approach this as follows:

### Step 1: Research
Use different online maps (e.g. google maps, opens street map, etc) to identify the conneected land masses in your city and the bridges connecting them. 
Make a list of spots where the maps are ambiguous. For example you may wonder if some of the bridges are actually legally and safly walkable, ect. 

### Step 2: Scouting
Go on some scouting trips to have a look at the ambiguous spots. Also perhaps also scout out some likely walking routes between them. (But be remember to 
be safe. If an area is too dodgy you probably wouldn't want to include it in your walk anyway.)

### Step 3: Make the rules
Cities that make nice and interesting bridgewalks immediately are pretty rare. You may find that you have too many nodes of odd degree 
or that the walk is too long or too boring, or all kinds of other problems. But you can make your own rules and sometimes that can fix things.

In Bristol I decided to consider only those bridges that would be included in the KÃ¶nigsberg problem, so only legally walkable bridges that are 
suitable for a sunday afternoon walk. I also excluded some minor bridges that were far from the main river network and bridges that cross other things then 
rivers. Otherwise the walk would have been much too long. Also for instance bridges over roads etc. hardly pose a challenge in the context of the bridge problem
as one can usually simply go around them if one would be tempted to cross one a second time. 

So for your city you want to make plausible rules such that the problem is solvable and makes a nice walk.
