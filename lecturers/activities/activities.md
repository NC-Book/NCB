# Ideas for Classroom Activities
Below a number of activities are listed that you can use to get your students started thinking and discussing about networks. 
I use these for inverted classroom activities where the student watch the technical content before on youtube. Then we
use the time in class to discussions like these and to work on projects. 

* [Networks are everywhere](act1.md) -- Motivational activity to emphasize the importance of networks and inspire interest (for Lec. 1)
* [Think of a network](act2.md) -- A soft introduction to modelling with networks that emphasises the need to bend networks (for Lec. 2)
* [A walk in the park](act3.md) -- Hands on application of the Chinese Postman problem. (for Lec. 3)
* *more coming soon*
